# Conway's Game of Life

Conway's Game of Life is a 2D cellular simulation based on rules, taking place on a grid with each cell having either an 'ON' of 'OFF' state. Every cell interactions with it's eight neighbors in each direction.

The rules are as follows:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
